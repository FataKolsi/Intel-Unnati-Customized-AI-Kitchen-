1. Collection of few sample images of common vegetables of Indian Household (tomato, carrot, capsicum, potato, brinjal, onion).
2. Annotation of the images into differnet classes using online annotation tool (CVAT) and exporting the task dataset in YOLO 1.1 format.
3. Creating a .yaml file to train a basic model using YOLOv8 with atleast 100 epochs.
4. Converting the 'best.pt' trained model into 'tflite' format to be used with android devices.
5. Tflite model was plugged into a android app code to verify the results realtime.
   
**These were the only preliminary task we were able to achieve due to our limited knowledge regarding coding in android studio.
-> We wanted to add an recipe generation algo with the output of the detection to get varied realtime results.
